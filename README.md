Day 12 Workshop Program
Write a HTML form that accepts a number between 1 and 30 (inclusive). Send the data to a backend controller with the GET method.
The backend controller will generate a list of numbers (n) according to the clientâ€™s request.
The controller will randomly generate a list of non-duplicate n numbers. The numbers are then displayed with the provided number images.
